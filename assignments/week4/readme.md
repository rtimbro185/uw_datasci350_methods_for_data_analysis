**Description:**
Assignment:    
* 1.) Compare and test Normality of the distributions of price and log price - use both a graphical method and a formal test    
* 2.) Test significance of price (log price) stratified by: a) fuel type, b) aspiration, c) rear vs. front wheel drive - use both graphical methods and the format test.    
* 3.) Apply ANOVA to the auto price data to compare the price (or log price if closer to a Normal distribution) of autos stratified by number of doors, and body style - two sets    of tests -Graphically explore the differences between the price conditioned by the categories of each variable 

* Use standard ANOVA and Tukey ANOVA to test the differences of these groups.
