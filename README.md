**ABOUT THIS COURSE:** <br>
Data analysis lies at the heart of data science. This course focuses on the fundamentals of data exploration and visualization along with important concepts of statistical theory. We’ll delve into more machine learning models. You’ll gain the skills to explore complex data relationships, utilize statistical methods and understand the foundations of machine learning algorithms. We’ll apply these methods to the analysis of several types of data sets, including time series data and text data.

**WHAT STUDENTS LEARN:**
* Methods for visualization and exploration of complex data sets and for communicating results to a non-technical audience
* Basic statistical models for data science analysis, including conditional distributions and Bayesian models
* An introduction to text analytics

**GET HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE:**
* Use multiple plot views and techniques such as  conditioning or faceting for both categorical and numeric values
* Construct and evaluate linear models using different regularization techniques
* Apply basic time series models for forecasting
